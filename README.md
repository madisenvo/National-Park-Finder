## Description
We created a webpage that allows a user to click on an interactive map in order to display the state's most popular national park. Our webpage also displays a five-day forecast so that they can prepare for the adventure they will soon embark on. In addition, our webpage will display a few other details about the park such as hours of operation, activites to do, cost and a picture of the park. 

# Usage 
* When the user views the top of the page they will see our header with links to additional resources and a contributors page.
