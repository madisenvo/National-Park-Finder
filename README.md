# National Park Finder


## Description
We created a webpage that allows a user to click on an interactive map in order to display the state's most popular national park with details, such as hours of operation, activites to do, entry costs, and a picture of the park. 

# Usage 
* When the user views the top of the page they will see our header with links to additional resources and a contributors page.

* The user can then navigate down and they will be presented with a map of the United States.

* If the user hovers over the map they will find that this map is interactive and clickable.
* When the user clicks on the map they will be presented with information on that state's most popular national park.

* The name of the park they selected will be saved to local storage. 
* The user can click on a different state to overide their current selection.
