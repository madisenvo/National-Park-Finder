 https://rarellano5280.github.io/National-Park-Finder/

## Description
We created a webpage that allows a user to click on an interactive map in order to display the state's most popular national park. Our webpage also displays a five-day forecast so that they can prepare for the adventure they will soon embark on. In addition, our webpage will display a few other details about the park such as hours of operation, activites to do, cost and a picture of the park.
